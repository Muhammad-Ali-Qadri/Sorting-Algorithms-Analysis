# Sorting-Algorithms-Analysis
Insertion sort, Merge sort(iterative and recursive), quick Sort (deterministic and randomized) and heap sort written in Java language. Outputs the time taken (in milliseconds) and the number of exchanges and comparisons. 
Different classes for each type of sorting algorithm.
The Analyzer class is just for counting and recording the exchanges and the comparisons made in each algorithm.
The Main class will be used to run and test the algorithms.

The results.xlsx file contains my analysis of the algorithms. 
The algorithms were tested and average of 5 runs was recorded for number of exchanges, comparisons and the time taken. For each of the test bases a graph is drawn with multiple lines, each indicating a different algorithm used.
